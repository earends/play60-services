# IntraConnect-Services

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Intra Connect (not final name) started out as a simple data base project using express and pug files. It is now a full fledged react application with a front end (IntraConnect) and a backend (IntraConnect-services). The backend continues to use express and node.js with a mongodb integration. The front end uses React, Bootstrap, leaflet, and few other small 3rd party libraries. 


To run, you will need to 
  - repo both IntraConnect and IntraConnect Services
  - delete both node modules if they are still there
  - call npm install in your terminal on both projects
  - make a mlab account
  - link to the data base
